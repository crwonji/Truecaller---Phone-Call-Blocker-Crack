- Caller ID
Truecaller’s real-time caller ID shows you the name of the person or business calling, even if the number isn’t saved in your phone. This helps you decide if you want to answer or ignore the call.

- Spam Call Blocker
The app automatically blocks known spam and scam numbers using its community-reported database. You can also manually block specific numbers or entire series (like telemarketer prefixes).

- Smart SMS
Truecaller isn’t just for calls—it also sorts and organizes your SMS messages. It separates spam texts from real ones and even lets you safely view OTPs and bank alerts in a focused inbox.

- Call Recording (Android Only)
Some versions of Truecaller allow you to record phone calls, which can be useful for keeping track of important conversations. Be sure to check local laws regarding call recording before using this feature.
